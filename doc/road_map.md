Road Map {#road_map}
=====================

 - **Framework:** In v0.3 we have integrated single-GPU and multi-GPU frameworks
   into a unified framework. We are exploring more operators such as
   Gather-Reduce and matrix operators. Generally we want to find the right set
   of operators that can abstract most graph primitives while delivering high
   performance.

 - **Primitives:** Our near-term goal is to implement maximal independent set
   and graph matching algorithms, build better support for bipartite
   graph algorithms, and explore community detection algorithms. Our long term
   goals include algorithms on dynamic graphs, priority queue support, graph
   partitioning, and more flexible and scalable multi-GPU algorithms.
