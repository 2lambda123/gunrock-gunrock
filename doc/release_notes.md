Gunrock release 0.3 is a feature release that adds two new graph primitives: Stochastic Approach for Link-Structure Analysis (SALSA) and Minimal Spanning Tree (MST), and improves several existing primitives. The new release uses a unified framework for both single-GPU and single-node multi-GPUs. Six graph primitives (BFS, DOBFS, CC, PR, BC, and SSSP) can be launched on multi-GPUs now by adding "--device=gpu_idx_1, gpu_idx_2,...,gpu_idx_n". A stats logging and performance chart generating pipeline is developed and integrated in this new release.
